# CodewellChallenge
This is my attempt on recreating the challanges on codewell 
Took me about a day but was fun and got to learn new stuffs
Great project and will recommend it for beginners

This project is not yet complete although it's responsive it's missing the key nav menu on smaller devices
The java part of it is still a todo and will keep updating as I go on.
